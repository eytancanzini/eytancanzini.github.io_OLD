- name: Autonomous ePuck Movement
  i18n: epuck
  gh_user: eytancanzini
  repo: epuck-autonomous-project
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/epuck.png
  desc: This project was an autonomous ePuck that used two different methods for navigation. The first is a virtual force field that protects the ePuck, and the second is an artifical potential field that directs the ePuck to the goal.

- name: Helios Solar Project
  i18n: helios
  gh_user: eytancanzini
  repo: heliosproject
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/sun-img.png
  desc: This is a potential open-source project that aims to design and build a fully autonomous solar tracking panel that orientates itself to face the Sun, thus increasing the electrical output of the panel. I am hoping to build this project further.

- name: Autonomous Movement Algorithms
  i18n: slam_car
  gh_user: eytancanzini
  repo: slam_car
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/car.png
  desc: One area I want to specialise more in is autonomous movement algorithms. After spending some time with two different textbooks, Planning Algorithms and Probabilistic Robotics, I want to build an architecture for autonomous movement using a variety of different algorithms. Eventually I will branch out into deep learning, but this is a future step.

- name: Time Series Forecasting
  i18n: ml_forecasting
  gh_user: eytancanzini
  repo: ml_forecasting
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/stock.png
  desc: This was a week long project to use neural networks and time series forecasting to build a stock price predictor. The algorithm was sucessful on certain stocks once trained and could do with some extra work designing certain areas of the algorithm.
